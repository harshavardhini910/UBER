UBER - Supply Demand Gap Analysis

On travelling to and from the airport by Uber, many a times the users have faced the problem of cancellation by the driver or non-availability of cars. Well, if these are the problems faced by customers, these very issues also impact the business of Uber. If drivers cancel the request of riders or if cars are unavailable, Uber loses out on its revenue. The aim of analysis is to identify the root cause of the problem (i.e. cancellation and non-availability of cars) so that Uber can increase its profitability.

Ater data cleaning and preparation, plots have been created to visualise the frequency of requests that get cancelled or show 'no cars available'; The most problematic types of requests (city to airport / airport to city etc.) and the time slots (early mornings, late evenings etc.) are identified using plots

Also, the gap between supply and demand is shown using plots.
